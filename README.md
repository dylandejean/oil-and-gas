# PA and ND Oil Well Shut-In Model
The goal of this report is to model the chances of a horizontal oil well being shut in based on factors such as production size, water waste, etc. The report uses both probit and logistic models to achieve this. In this repository is a PDF of the final report, an .RMD file containing the code used to generate the report, as well as all related data files used in analysis.
